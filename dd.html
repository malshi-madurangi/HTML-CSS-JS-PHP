            <h4>Harris Wijeyasinghe</h4>

            <p>"I met Dhanajaya when he was very young. We have a very personal relationship. I feel like he would have
              been my son in a previous birth. I noticed his talent from the very beginning and encouraged him. I
              believe his mother was his pillar of strength for his development. Of course it should be mentioned that
              Dhanajaya is a person with an inborn talent. I may have given him a push by letting him look at my work
              but I was not his teacher. He created his identity for himself with his talent and a little bit of
              guidance.</p>

            <p>The Bridal field is a very challenging field, I always tell him that religion should be his guide. Today,
              he has done well, he has brushed up and developed immensely. He has come up in the field quite fast and is
              now quite a household name. His creations are lovely and I am extremely happy about his success."</p>

            <p>"I met Dhanajaya about 14 years ago. I think, he dressed me as a bride for a show before I got married. I
              immediately recognized his talent. He has grown so much over the years.</p>

            <p>What I like about him is that he keeps the tradition alive in his designs and modernizes where necessary.
              It is always a very good combination and he makes sure they complement one another. He probably does the
              best make-up in the country and I always go to him whenever I have to go somewhere. He is an extremely
              talented person whose designs are quite inspiring."</p>

              His humility and willingness to help others makes him a very special person, I wish him all the best."</p>
